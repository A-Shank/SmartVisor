# SmartVisor

NOTE: I am aware that some of the Header files are utterly useless, code structure will be optimized as well as Project structre. The Code here is supposed to be a reference. 

If you are using the Arduino IDE, make sure you are deleting the includes and check if all dependencies as well as libraries are installed. Regarding the Header files and CPP files you should be able to move everything into one INO File to make this useable. The one custom library that the project is using is the AccelStepper Library. DO NOT forget to install this otherwise some of the code will not work! Comments are included to the best of my abilities, i did not explain everything. For questions feel free to message me on Teams.


IMPORTANT:
The project uses the AccelStepper Library. Make sure it is installed and paths are correct for the project. For documentation purposes visit: https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/.
