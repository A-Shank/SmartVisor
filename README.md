# SmartVisor

There are currently some semi useless Header files. Code will be optimized soon in order to make less Header files and make it in general more compact.

IMPORTANT:
The project uses the AccelStepper Library. Make sure it is installed and paths are correct for the project. For documentation purposes visit: https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/.

Since Platform IO uses cpp files, DO NOT forget to delete the includes if you are using ino files. Further more make sure to read the comments everything should be explained to the best of my abilities.
